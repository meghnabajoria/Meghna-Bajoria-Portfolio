In this study, I carried out a comprehensive analysis of graduate earnings and labor force information using a dataset named "recent-grads.csv". The dataset provided data on college students who were less than 28 years of age, broken down by sex and job type. It also included information about the major the students had in college.

The primary objectives of my study were to answer questions such as which major is preferred by men and women, which major brings the highest income, if there is a gender pay gap in certain majors, and which majors lead to part-time or full-time employment. This study aimed to provide useful insights for current students considering their future career paths.

The data for the study was sourced from a GitHub repository and was collected via Ballotpedia and the American Community Survey. I cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, which included removing outliers and handling missing values.

The study involved a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis, where I utilized visualization techniques to understand the trends and patterns in the data. Hypothesis testing was also conducted to test specific claims about graduate earnings.

Moreover, I performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dataset's dimensionality while retaining important information. This was instrumental in understanding the primary factors influencing graduate earnings.

The results of the study yielded interesting findings, such as the fact that Petroleum Engineering had the highest median salary, while Library Science had the lowest. The study also revealed that there were more female than male graduates.

Through this project, I developed and enhanced my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and PCA. This experience has honed my abilities in deriving actionable insights from complex data, a key skill in data science and analytics.
